# Linear Equation Solver
GUI app to solve systems of linear equations using Gauss-Seidel method.
Written in C++, using wxWidgets library for interface.


## Examples:
1. converging, ans = [1 2 -1 1]
2. converging, ans = [1 3 4]
3. converging, ans = [-2 3 1]
4. converging, ans ~= [0.8122 -0.6650]
5. not converging
6. not converging
